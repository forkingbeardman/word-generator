# word-generator
 Get the list of words that contain only characters searched by the user

This project is born of boredome and having an aspiring typeface designer as a sister.

Heavily inspired by (one might say copied the idea from) https://www.adhesiontext.com/ by Miguel Sousa 
adhesiontext tool is amazing for typography during the process of developing fonts as it generates a text using real words from input letters. This can be used to preview only the parts of the font you have finished and/or help identify kerning issues.
However, it lacked the support of georgian language which made me cobble up this solution.

Note that the following is a work of a person who has next to no knowledge of php/html/css and only enough skill to browse github and stackoverflow and w3schools to find solutions to his problems.

Current State:
1. Does what it says above and only that.
2. Currently supports only georgian language (however included txt dictionaries for language and georgian char list can be replaced by other languages and it should still work)
3. Supports Old Georgian ("Asomtavruli") and Mid Georgian ("Nuskha-khutsuri") scripts
4. Supports adding random numbers
5. Supports random punctuation marks
6. Word limit dropdown
7. somewhat responsive design

Issues:
1. Georgian dictionary definitely needs improving as it contains words that are not real words in Georgian language. (fortunately can be done without modifying the code)
2. I am sure a ton that i am unaware of, so you tell me :)

my greatest thanks goes to:
 * Miguel Sousa for amazing tool
 * TheMathewNorman for his Substring-Search project which helped me get started
 * akalongman for his amazing 193k+ list of words.
  * my brother for designing desktop and mobile UI and sorry for butchering it ))))
